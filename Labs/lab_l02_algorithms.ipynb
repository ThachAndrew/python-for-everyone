    "An algorithm is a sequence of steps that performs a task. Programmers learn to take complex tasks and break them down into steps they've learned. Sometimes it's hard to figure out how to break down a problem. When you're stuck it's best to start by copying example code that works. This notebook will use the turtle which will help you understand algorithms. "
