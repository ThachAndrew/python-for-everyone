    "According to Wikipedia the average solar year is\n",
    "\n",
    " * 365 days\n",
    " * 5 hours\n",
    " * 48 minutes\n",
    " * 45 seconds\n",

    "Write a program that calculates the number of seconds in a mean solar year and prints the calculation. Start by storing each of the days, hours, minutes and seconds in a variable. Like this:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "days = 365 \n",

    "Your program should produce output that looks exactly like mine. Be precise! \n",

    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    " * All Python files must have a properly formatted docstring\n",
    " * Submit your program in a file called `using_variables.py`\n",
    " * Your program must print only one number, the number of seconds in a solar year\n",
    " * You can print any other words you want\n",
    " * **DO NOT** print any other numbers!\n",

    " * using_variables.py\n",
    "\n",
    "The file should be zipped inside of the `Lesson02` directory and submitted with your completed practice notebooks. \n"
