    "# Project: Madlib Game\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you'll take user input to create a Mad Lib generator. Haven't heard of Mad Libs? It's a word game: \n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.madlibs.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Mad Libs are like templates. Here's a PDF of some typical Mad Libs: \n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.madlibs.com/content/uploads/2016/04/KIDS-excuse-hall-pass_1_.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "One person knows the template and asks for particular types of words (e.g. noun, adjective). The player that picks the words doesn't know the template. At the end the template is read with the randomly picked words and hilarity ensues. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The Madlib template is inside of a file. Here's an example of the contents of a Madlib file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{}! he said {} as he jumped into his convertible and drove off with his {} wife.\n",
    "exclamation\n",
    "adverb\n",
    "adjective\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The file will always have exactly four lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. A Madlib template with three embedded `{}` holes. \n",
    "  2. The *type* of word used to fill the first blank\n",
    "  3. The *type* of word used to fill the second blank \n",
    "  4. The *type* of word used to fill the third blank\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Game \n",
    "\n",
    "Your program needs to know what file the madlib template is located in. That information comes from the command line. In class you learned how to use command line arguments in Cloud9. You can use command line arguments either directly from the terminal or using the run mode in Cloud9. Here's an example of how your program will be run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python3.6 project5.py madlib_example_1.txt\n",
    "Please enter a(n) noun:\n",
    "Please enter a(n) color:\n",
    "Please enter a(n) adjective:\n",
    "... \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should work with different Mad Libs. There are files in the Lesson05 directory with samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. `madlib_example_1.txt`\n",
    "  2. `madlib_example_2.txt`\n",
    "  3. `madlib_example_3.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "Your program performs steps that you learned in class. Your first task is to break down the task into steps. To help you get started here are the tasks that your program must complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the argument from the comand line. This is the filename of the madlib file. \n",
    "2. Open the file and read its contents \n",
    "3. Ask the user for three word *types*. The word types are what are mentioned in the file. \n",
    "4. Complete the madlib and print it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin coding copy these steps into your code using comments like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "CIS-15 Madlibs\n",
    "Mike Matera\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Get the argument \n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Open the file\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now look through your notes to see how to do each of the steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "  - All files must have a docstring with the class and your name. \n",
    "  - Submit your program in a file called `madlibs.py`\n",
    "    - Your program must take one argument (the name of a file) \n",
    "    - You can assume the file will always be correct (you don't have to handle errors) \n",
    "    - You must print the completed Mad Lib on a line by itself.\n",
    "    - You must close all files before your program exits. \n"
