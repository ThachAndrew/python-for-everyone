    "# Project: Designing with Functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you'll redesign your [Mad Libs](../Projects/project_madlib_files.ipynb) project to use functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Refactoring Mad Libs\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming *refactoring* is when you change code to improve it's functionality or readability. In this project you will refactor MadLibs to use functions. Before you start make sure that your Mad Libs code works reliably. The best way to refactor is to make small changes, then retest your code to make sure the changes didn't break anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin your project in a file called `madlibs_functions.py` and start with the code below: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def main(): \n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__' :\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by taking all of the code from your Mad Lib generator and moving it into the `main()` function. Retest your Mad Lib generator to make sure it still works after you move code into `main()`. Once you're satisfied that your program still works add the following functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Function name: `read_madlib_file`\n",
    "    * Read the MadLib template file and return the first four lines (the MadLib template and three word types).\n",
    "    * Arguments:\n",
    "        * `filename`: The name of a MadLib template file. \n",
    "    * Returns: `mad_lib`, `word_type_1`, `word_type_2`, `word_type_3`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function name `ask_one_word`\n",
    "    * This function prompts the user for **one** word and takes one argument called `word_type`. The function prompts the user for a word and must print the contents of `word_type` in the prompt. \n",
    "    * Arguments:\n",
    "        * `word_type`: The type of word to prompt for. \n",
    "    * Returns: The word typed by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function name `save_madlib` \n",
    "    * This function displays the Mad Lib and saves the output to a file. It takes one arguments, `mad_lib_complete`, that contains the completed madlib. The function prints the completed madlib and saves the completed madlib to a file called `madlib.out`  \n",
    "    * Arguments:\n",
    "        * `mad_lib_complete`: The completed Mad Lib \n",
    "    * Returns: None\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function name `main`\n",
    "    * This function runs your madlib program. You should call your other functions inside of main. \n",
    "    * Arguments: `None`\n",
    "    * Returns: `None` \n",
    "  \n",
    " \n",
    "**Write your functions one at a time and retest your code after each one.** Be sure to close all files. Each function must have a docstring that describes the function, its arguments and return values where applicable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Starter Code \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's code to get you started: \n",
    "\n",

    "CIS-15 Madlibs Functions\n",

    "```\n",

    "## Requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "  * **There should be no code outside of a function** except the following:\n",
    "    * Any `import` statements \n",
    "    * The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` lines at the bottom of the starter code.\n",
    "  * Your code should have the functions listed, and they must be named exactly as requested \n",
    "    * Each function must have a docstring that describes it \n",
    "    * Each function must have the described arguments and return values \n",
    "  * Your code must be in a file name `madlibs_functions.py` "
