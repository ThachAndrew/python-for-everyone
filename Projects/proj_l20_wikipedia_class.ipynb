    "# Wikipedia Helper \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will use a Python class to create an Appilcation Programming Interface (API) to help access Wikipedia. You can get programmatic data in the [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. JSON is easy to translate into Python dictionaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Wikipedia Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Wikipedia class should have the following definition: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Name: `Wikipedia`\n",
    "- Functions:\n",
    "  - `__init__` - The class initializer\n",
    "    - Arguments:\n",
    "      - `self`: The class instance \n",
    "      - `page`: The title of a page to access. \n",
    "  - `exists` - Returns `True` if the page exists, `False` otherwise. \n",
    "    - Arguments: `None`\n",
    "    - Returns: `True` or `False`\n",
    "  - `extract` - Return the extract of the page. \n",
    "    - Arguments: `None`\n",
    "    - Returns: The page extract as a string. \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Getting the Page Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting page information from Wikipedia is easy (if you know how to do it). The `wiki_fetch.py` program in Lesson11 shows you how. The program shows you the dictionary that's returned by Wikipedia. You should look at the output closely to learn the structure. \n",

    "The program takes an argument. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
