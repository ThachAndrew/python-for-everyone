    "# Project: An Inventory System \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will harness the power of dictionaries to make a simple inventory system that is operated on the command line. The inventory system can load and save inventory files to maintain a dictionary of items for sale. The inventory contains the following data for each item:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The name of an item. *Hint: use this as the dictionary key*\n",
    "  - The available quantity of the item. \n",
    "  - The cost of the item to buy or sell.\n",
    "  \n",
    "When you start your program the shop has a balance of zero. You can sell items to increase your balance and use the money to buy more items. Your inventory system must obey the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The balance should never go below zero. \n",
    "  - You cannot sell more items than you have. "

    "## The Command Line Interface \n",
    "\n",
