    "# Character Encoding \n",
    "\n",
    "To the computer all data is a bunch of binary numbers, including strings, pictures and videos. So how do you get from a bunch of numbers to a string? There is an agreed upon way to convert the numbers into letters. The agreed upon way is called a *character encoding*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The oldest character encoding that's still in use is called [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII uses seven bits to represent 128 different characters. Why so many? To the computer upper case letters are different from lower case letters and there are a whole bunch of special characters. Special characters control how a string looks or is printed. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few special characters that are important to know. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Binary | Hex | Decimal | String Notation | Meaning | \n",
    "|-|-|-|-|-| \n",
    "| 000 0000 | 0x00 | 0 | \\0 | Null character. There must be one at the end of every string. | \n",
    "| 000 1001 | 0x09 | 9 | \\t | Tab character. Adds an adjustable amount of whitespace. | \n",
    "| 000 1010 | 0x0a | 10 | \\n | Line feed. Starts a new line of text on UNIX. | \n",
    "| 000 1101 | 0x0d | 13 | \\r | Carriage return. On Windows \\r\\n together start a new line of text.| \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the special characters are leftovers from the days when there were no computer monitors. In those days the UNIX command line was typed out using a specially modifed typewriter called a [Teletype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter#/media/File:ASR-33_at_CHM.agr.jpg). \n",

    "## UTF Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a problem with ASCII. What about if you want to interchange information with non-Americans? ASCII only contains the English alphabet, so you can't write things in other languages. In 1960 when ASCII was developed few other coutries had computers. Now, people all over the world have computers in their pocket. To address this problem the UTF family of encodings was created. UTF is short for Unicode Transformation Format. UTF encodings contain enough characters for every human language *and emojis!*\n",
    "\n",
    "In ASCII every character is one byte (8-bits, with only 7 used). UTF characters can be between one and four bytes (8 to 32 bits). The `ord` and `chr` functions are only work on single-byte characters so the new functions `encode` and `decode` are used to do the same job. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Byte Strings \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand what `encode` and `decode` do you need to know about a type of string that I haven't mentioned yet. The b-string is used to express *raw bytes*. Raw bytes are a bunch of numbers. They can be converted to strings using an encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you specify a b-string. Each hexadecimal value in the b-string starts with `\\x`. So `\\x01` is how you write hexadecimal 0x01. \n",

    "```python\n",
    "bytes = b'\\xF0\\x9F\\x98\\xB8'\n",
