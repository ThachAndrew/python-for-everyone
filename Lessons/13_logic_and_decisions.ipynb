    "What if you wanted your code to do different things based on user input? For example, suppose you want to play a game that prints different things based on a choice. The `if` statement allows you to conditionally run Python statements. Here's a diagram of an `if` statement:\n",

    "The `if` statement conditionally runs instructions inside the body of the if statement. The code is only run if the condition evaluates to `True`. In other words, the `print` function in the picture may or may not run depending on the value of `number`. \n",

In the example above the code is asking \"if `number` is equal to `34`?\" There are many forms a question can take but they all have one thing in common: They will result in a `True` or `False` value.
