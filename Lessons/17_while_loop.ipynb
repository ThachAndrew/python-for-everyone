    "The `while` loop is known as the *indefinite* loop. You use it when you *can't know* how many times you need to go through the loop. The `while` loop continues looping while the *loop condition* is `True` and exits the loop when the condition is `False`. The `while` loop is less common than the `for` loop but still essential for most programs. \n",

Getting stuck in an infinite loop is one of the ways a program can crash and become unresponsive. So more care is needed when you program a `while` loop. Sometimes `while` loops are written as infinite loops with a `break` or `return` statement that terminates the loop. Here's the input validation function again:"
